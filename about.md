    <p>My name is Aaron and I live in Chicago.  I also drink too much excellent coffee.  I currently work for an awesome company called Civis Analytics where I do the "Devops".</p>

    <p>My intention for this blog is to document things I learn in my professional day-to-day travels.  It will mostly be a notebook for instructions, HOWTOs, and tips that I find useful.  In documenting these things here, I hope that it will help reinforce the learning process and possibly assist others by having the knowledge shared publicly.</p>

    <p>You will also notice on my sidebar that I have a link to photo galleries. I will also be featuring street photography from my personal collection. These images will mostly feature Chicago but you may see galleries for other places at a later date.</p>

Topics I'll be posting about:

* Linux
* AWS
* Configuration Management
* Ruby and Python Scripting
* Devops Methodology
* Certifications (Red Hat & AWS)
* Personal Projects
