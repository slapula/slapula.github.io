![Aaron](/assets/images/other/me.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is Aaron and I live in Chicago.  I also drink too much excellent coffee.
I currently work for an awesome company called Civis Analytics where I do the
"Devops".  

My intention for this blog is to document things I learn in my day-to-day travels.
Or a public notebook for things I'd rather not devote brain space to.


Topics I'll be posting about:

* Linux
* AWS
* Configuration Management
* Ruby and Python Scripting
* Devops Methodology
* Certifications (Red Hat & AWS)
* Personal Projects

Thanks for reading!
