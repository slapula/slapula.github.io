    <p>My name is Aaron and I live in Chicago.  I also drink too much excellent coffee.  I currently work for an awesome company called Civis Analytics where I do the "Devops".</p>

    <p>My intention for this blog is to document things I learn in my day-to-day travels.  Or a public notebook for things I'd rather not devote brain space to.</p>
</div>â€‹
Topics I'll be posting about:

* Linux
* AWS
* Configuration Management
* Ruby and Python Scripting
* Devops Methodology
* Certifications (Red Hat & AWS)
* Personal Projects
