    <p>My name is Aaron and I live in Chicago.  I also drink too much excellent coffee.  I currently work for an awesome company called Civis Analytics where I do the "Devops".</p>

    <p>My intention for this blog is to document things I learn in my day-to-day travels and how I can apply the lessons learned through studying Buddhism.</p>
